Inspired by the original `gparted_shell` from Puppy Linux, rewritten for modern Linux systems using `yad` and `lsblk` instead of `gtkdialog` and `probedisk`.

## Why this wrapper

GParted launched directly will scan **all** connected drives at startup. On systems with multiple disks or USB devices this causes a slow and unnecessary probe. This wrapper lets you pick exactly the drive you want before GParted opens — making it faster to start and safer to use, since there is no risk of accidentally operating on the wrong device.

One drive, one window, on purpose.

## Dependencies

| Package | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `gparted` | The partition editor |
| `yad` | GTK dialog for drive selection |
| `lsblk` | Drive detection (part of `util-linux`) |

### Installation

1. **Make the script executable and install it to a directory in your `$PATH`:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x gparted-launch
   sudo cp gparted-launch ~/.local/bin/
   ```
   *(Replace `~/.local/bin/` with your preferred location, e.g., `~/bin/` if it exists or `/usr/local/bin/`.)*

2. **(Optional) Install the desktop shortcut:**
   - Edit `gparted.desktop` and update the `Exec=` line to match the path where you installed `gparted-launch`.
   - Copy the file to your applications directory:
     ```bash
     cp gparted.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/
     ```

## Usage

Run from terminal or launch via menu:
```bash
gparted-launch
```

- A dialog lists all detected drives with name, type, size and model. 
- Select one and click **Launch**. 
- GParted opens directly on that device. 
- To work on a different drive, close GParted and run the launcher again.
